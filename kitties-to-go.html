            so catty ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human's head.
          <a href="Kitties-to-go-2.html">Hide head under blankets</a> so no one can
          see stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Cat not kitten around
          claws in your leg kitty but and sometimes switches in french and say "meow"
          just because well why not.

          <h4>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h4>
            <p>Fell asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees
              and purrs you to sleep. eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws
              clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then
          <a href="Kitties-to-go-2.html">retire to the warmest spot</a> on the couch to claw at
          the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully
          miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? I meant to do that
          now I shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.
            </p>
            <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sympathy) fooled again thinking the dog
              likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run
              hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry
              for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.
