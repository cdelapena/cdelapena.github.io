        <p>"I really love archery."</p>
        <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and
          accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery
          Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and  started Straight
          to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery education
          options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies came out,
          he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young
          women, and the business has been booming ever since.</p>
